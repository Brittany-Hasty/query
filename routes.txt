Backend: 
    users
        GET /api/users
        POST /api/users
        --> display users, new users

    session
        POST /api/users
        DELETE /api/session
        --> login, logout

    posts
        GET /api/posts
        GET /api/posts/:id
        POST /api/posts
        PATCH /api/post/:id
        DELETE /api/post/:id
        --> show all posts, show one post, create new post, edit post, delete post

    comments
        GET /api/:post_id/comments
        POST /api/:post_id/comments
        PATCH /api/:post_id/comments/:id
        DELETE /api/:post_id/comments/:id
        --> show all comments, make new comment, edit comment, delete comment
            (cannot view only one comment, all show at once - by design)

    likes
        POST /api/:post_id/likes
        DELETE /api/:post_id/likes
        --> "make" a like, "delete" a like

    shares
        POST /api/:post_id/shares
        DELETE /api/:post_id/shares
        --> create a share, delete a share
            (I forsee future problems implementing this share functionality to 
                create new posts for the current user. New routes or limitations may
                need to be added to these shared posts so that the user cannot modify
                the original post when they repost)
